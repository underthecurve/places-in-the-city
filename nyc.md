# places in nyc

- my (christine's) favorite places in nyc. mostly manhattan b/c that's where i lived back in the day. feel free to add to the list!

- note manhattan is not huge so some of these neighborhood designations are arbitrary. e.g., otto (italian restaurant under 'food') is under east village but not far from SoHo, etc.

## food 

### chinatown
- note there are TWO chinatowns in nyc, the one in manhattan (which the below refers to) & the one in flushing, queens. highly recommend checking out the flushing one b/c it's MUCH bigger and less touristy. dim sum is especially good there at places such as [this one](http://www.yelp.com/biz/jade-asian-restaurant-and-caterer-flushing)

- [nice green bo](http://www.yelp.com/biz/nice-green-bo-restaurant-new-york-6): legit shanghai food. recommend the kau fu (tofu appetizer that unlike most tofu is actually flavorful) & BEST soup dumplings (much better than Joe's Shanghai which is the more touristy spot across the street)

- [num wah tea parlor](http://nomwah.com/): the first dim sum restaurant in nyc. on a winding street (rare for nyc) called doyers street. no dim sum carts but food is fresher than more touristy places

- [ping's seafood](http://www.yelp.com/biz/pings-seafood-new-york): another dim sum place (don't worry, it's not JUST seafood). good to have several dim sum options b/c these places can get crowded!

- [ten ren's tea time](http://www.yelp.com/biz/ten-rens-tea-time-new-york): has gotten a lot more tourisy since I live in nyc but still my fave bubble tea spot. get the taro milk tea w/ bubbles.

- [golden steamer](http://www.seriouseats.com/venue/golden-steamer): or any chinatown bakery, really. i like this one b/c their steamed buns are excellent - get the pumpkin one in the fall.

- [peking duck house](http://www.pekingduckhousenyc.com/?page_id=6): seriously the BEST peking duck i've had, maybe even including the one i had in beijing. go to the chinatown (mott st) location, NEVER the midtown one. reservations are a good idea.

- [hong kong supermarket](http://www.yelp.com/biz/hong-kong-supermarket-new-york-3): asian grocery. enough said.

### west side

- [levain bakery](http://www.levainbakery.com/): my FAVORITE cookie place. seriously unlike any other cookie you've ever had. best if you microwave them a bit before eating. when people go to nyc i ask them to bring me back the chocolate chocolate one.

- [charlie bird](http://charliebirdnyc.com/): i've never been but friend says 'dinner here will change your life. period.'

- [joseph leonard](http://josephleonard.com/): another superb brunch spot.
